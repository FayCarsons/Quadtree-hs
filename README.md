A simple implementation of a Quadree + visualizer I wrote in Haskell to get more comfortable with the language.

The project can be run with `cabal run`, which will produce a PNG in the root of the directory.
Play around with the constants in the top of `Main.hs` to get different outputs!

An example output:
()[Quadtree-example.png]
